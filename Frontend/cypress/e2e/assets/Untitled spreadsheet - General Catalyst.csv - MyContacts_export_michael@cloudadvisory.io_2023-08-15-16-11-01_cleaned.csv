We began by helping people understand and track their home’s with the Zestimate, our proprietary algorithm, and then with advanced technology and valuable connections with real estate professionals. Today, Zillow has become a household name. People are more likely to search for “Zillow” than “real estate,” and our name is often used as a verb. 
While other industries have ushered in a new era of convenience, the time for seamless and convenient real estate experience is now. This is our next chapter as a company.

Let's face it, most off the rack purchases just don't fit right. Mass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size. And different brands have different standards for sizing. That is why so many men end up shopping in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits!

Vastrm's Founder, Jonathan Tang, came up with Vastrm's custom fit polo shirt concept while frustrated with the hordes of baggy boxy polos that were available on the market. He refused to compromise with the ill fitting shirts and resolved to find a better way to get men in better fitting polos.

We designed a system that will give you the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of our apparel. With Vastrm, you will finally be able to define the perfect fit for your unique body type, whether you are extremely athletic (we can help design an athletic fit polo to accentuate those muscles), are looking for an extreme slim fit, have a couple of pounds to lose, are looking for big and tall polo shirts or just want something that doesn't feel like a bag!",vastrm.com,,Apparel & Fashion,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1218769,$101K-$1M,5,2-10 employees

But never despair, even when it seems you are lost...we have each other to pray for us in the Church, Angels and Saints in Heaven, and even any who might be in the unmentionable place....they are also servants, We are all children of God, for all were created by Him, remember this and then you will know HIM.",onuniverse.com,,Civic & Social Organization,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1933386,$5M-$20M,7,2-10 employees

Founded out of MIT in 2013, Superpedestrian develops technologies for micro-electric vehicles that optimize safety, reliability, and performance. 

Superpedestrian spent over 4 years developing its proprietary Vehicle Intelligence System (VIS), which was first introduced in the company’s consumer product, the Copenhagen Wheel. Since 2018, Superpedestrian has focused its efforts on engineering and validating its new electric scooter for shared fleets. In 2020, the company launched its vehicles under the brand name LINK. 

Featuring the mature VIS platform, Superpedestrian’s fleet scooter can detect and protect against more than 100 common malfunctions.  This platform of embedded computers and cloud software enables Superpedestrian’s scooters to autonomously protect from damage during and between rides. Within nanoseconds, the scooters can detect potential problems such as battery fires, short circuits, or failed brakes, and take corrective action to avert damage. 

Vehicle Intelligence prevents over 50% of issues that would cause other scooters to fail, and streamlines operations if issues arise. If the scooter can’t protect itself, it automatically becomes unavailable for rental and generates a detailed service ticket for repair. The result is a substantial improvement in vehicle safety for scooter riders and major cost savings for fleet operators.

Social is our sauce. On Snackpass, you can unlock discounts with friends, send gifts, and collect points 🎁 Our users tell us that Snackpass is the most fun way to order food — that other food apps feel formal and boring in comparison.

We're starting with college campuses. We have an advantage here — we started Snackpass while we were in college for us and our friends. Within a few months of launch, we had over 80% of Yale using the app. 18 months later, we are at 8 campuses and growing 📈

The future of the restaurant industry is mobile order — see Chipotle, Starbucks, Sweetgreen, Shake Shack. And the future of mobile payments is social. At Snackpass, we've found a way to make both work, packaged in a product that our users love and use on a daily basis.

We're looking for creative and ambitious people to join us and scale Snackpass from 10 campuses to 100 over the next year. We'd love to talk with you.

By connecting every workforce system to a single source of truth for employee data, businesses can automate all of the manual work they normally need to do to make employee changes.

We work with some of the UK's most exciting companies to deliver apprenticeships, including Digital Marketing at Google, Software Engineering at Sky, and are helping companies plug skills gaps in Data Science and Project Management by upskilling existing staff.

The way we approach apprenticeships is on a different level in terms of ambition and scale. We focus on three core areas; measuring potential beyond academics & work experience through our platform; delivering world-class teaching and content via applied learning programmes; and helping a diverse group of young people build social capital & strong networks through a thriving on-and-offline community.   

By developing high quality education and training that supports the needs of both employers and young people we're transforming apprenticeships and creating a credible alternative to even the best universities. We believe this will play a vital role in solving the UK’s skills gap, addressing inequalities in pay and opportunity, and challenging wider societal perceptions surrounding apprenticeships and how you access the best careers. 

The obvious move right now is going to university if you want a great job - that’s what everyone does. But this is such an imperfect system, one that employers, students, and governments are uncomfortable with. 

So we’re building something different, and it starts with apprenticeships.  ",multiverse.io,,Higher Education,https://www.linkedin.com/company/onemoremultiverse,$1M-$5M,50,11-50 employees

With our autonomous flight technology, Superpilot — we're transforming the way airplanes fly so regional mobility will be significantly safer, more efficient, accessible, and sustainable than ever.

Our work begins with converting today’s cargo aircraft into remotely-operated airplanes so every person in the world can have greater access to reliable and affordable delivery services no matter where they live. Beyond air cargo, we plan to expand our technology safely, scalably, and sustainably to other areas of commercial aviation. 

Founded in 2016, Xwing is based in Northern California with offices in San Francisco and Concord, CA. Fast Company named us one of the Most Innovative Transportation Companies of 2021 and a World Changing Idea in 2022; and TIME Magazine featured us on its 2021 Best Inventions List after completing the world’s first fully autonomous cargo flight.

Backed by strategic investors, we've raised over $57 million in venture funding to date, and we're partnering closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify our advanced aircraft.

The Minio S3-compatible object server is available as open source and through partners, and is widely used by customers building highly-reliable secure Private Clouds.

Unusual among object storage solutions, Minio’s ultra-high-performance architecture can saturate 100-GbE networks, even while providing full S3-API support, extraordinary data durability with erasure coding and bit-rot detection, and implementing state-of-the-art encryption and authentication.  Popular with developers bringing nextgen cloud-native apps to life, Minio is written in Go and is fully integrated with all the popular orchestration mechanisms widely used across the cloud ecosystem, including Kubernetes, Mesos, Docker Swarm, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  In a Multi-Cloud world, Minio provides customers greater flexibility and portability by enabling S3 API standardization independent of which public or private Cloud may be currently hosting their applications.

Object storage is fundamental both to web-scale public clouds and on-premises private cloud datacenters alike.  Simpler to deploy, administer, scale, and access over extended network connections than SAN or NAS alternatives, “object storage” has become synonymous with “cloud storage” and Minio has become an increasingly popular platform for storing unstructured data like photos, videos, VMs, containers, log files, IoT data streams, and so on.  Any blob of data can be stored as an object, and the AWS S3-API is increasingly the de facto standard for object storage data access methods, which is why Minio has fully implemented the S3 API.",min.io,,Computer Software,https://www.linkedin.com/company/minio-inc-,$1M-$5M,50,11-50 employees

Blueprint is a non-profit organization aimed at bringing technologies to local nonprofit organizations that are making social change. We want to aid and be part of the group of community builders who are doing meaningful productive work. Each semester, teams of five students work with non-profit organizations to implement technologies for efficiency and accessibility.

Omicron is a seasoned team of technologists, business strategists, finance wizards, marketers, engineers, and network architects who build, scale and manage large multi-protocol online companies. We have a long history of creating high-performing products for consumer and enterprise in the HTTP, NNTP, network, online storage, and security arenas.

Our roots go way back to early Internet days when we developed the software that powers the USENET, the world’s first social network.

The businesses created from that platform are still going strong today and creates the stability from which all our innovation originates. We leveraged that early USENET codebase to create a broad range of businesses including a massive content delivery network which delivers terabits of online video, games, and live streaming for the world’s most well-known media companies like Steam, Xbox, and Viacom. To carry all that data, we created from scratch a global IP network backbone. We then leveraged the IP network to create a VPN online privacy/security product that is being used globally by consumers and businesses to protect their internet activity. Over the years, we have acquired and integrated more than 12 online businesses, and raised more than $1 billion in financing for our efforts.

After a recent corporate reorganization, Omicron has emerged as an innovation incubator of scalable platform-based products leveraging our team’s experience to create the next generation of revolutionary and disruptive global online services.

We opened our first retail location in 2015 – taking the facial and indulgence out of the spa, elevating the estheticians as the experts they are, and removing the overwhelm out of building an at-home skincare routine. Today, we have 9 locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. We’ve performed 225,000 facials, collected data on skincare conditions, preferences, and purchases, and become an employer of choice for a world-class team of estheticians we call Heyday Skin Therapists.

Our next chapter is to take these ingredients and create unparalleled personalization and guidance across content, communities, recommendations, and services in both our physical stores and our e-commerce experience.

‘Heyday’ means a period of your life when you’re feeling at your best. Above all, we exist to help people achieve their ‘heyday’ – to show up in the world as their best selves, every day. We start with the skin you’re in.

Rooted in early childhood education principles of engagement, with a belief that children’s content should leverage mobile device capabilities so kids play instead of just watch, Hellosaurus is developing not just interactive kids’ shows but also the tools for creators worldwide to make their own shows for its platform.

This easy-to-use software platform includes tools that empower creators of high-quality kids programming -- especially those that have been using YouTube as a primary content hub -- to move beyond passive content as well as a single distribution platform to share creations with families everywhere. 

The Birthday Show is the first interactive show on Hellosaurus. It debuted in May 2020 and is free to play on tablets, computers, and phones at www.thebirthday.show (also at www.hellosaurus.com). In the coming months, Hellosaurus will be released as a native iOS application that will become the centralized touchscreen experience for all interactive content built with the Hellosaurus tools. This mobile application will be a curated, kid-safe, and ad-free experience that keeps kids actively learning and entertained on a moment's notice. Access to all interactive content will be offered to families as a monthly subscription, with subscription proceeds shared directly with creators.

Hellosaurus is made with love by people who brought you HQ Trivia, Toca Boca, Peekaboo Barn, and Sprout’s Sunny Side Up. For more, visit www.hellosaurus.com.

We were founded on the belief that getting help at work shouldn’t be so hard. While others have focused on solving the problems faced by help desk agents, Espressive shifted the focus to the employee—because you can’t have self-service if your employees are not engaged. However, this doesn’t mean the help desk is left behind. When you improve the employee experience through automation, you reduce redundant help desk work, enabling agents to focus on more strategic projects.

In 2015, we launched the first truly personalized and automated savings app that has helped members save over $7 billion towards their financial goals to date. Today, we fully automate the day-to-day work of managing all personal finances including banking, saving, budgeting, investing, and retirement.

Digit gives members the power of an all-in-one financial app that helps them effortlessly manage their money based on their individual financial situation and goals, alongside financial best practices. Our goal is to help members stress less about their money day-to-day while helping them build a strong foundation for their future.

This is especially important considering that financial health is the number one cause of stress in America. Seventy percent of Americans are financially unhealthy: one in five has zero retirement savings, the average college student graduates with $37K in student loans, and the national credit card debt has reached a record high of more than $1 trillion. Poor financial health can limit access to essentials like quality healthcare and education.

As one of the first companies to successfully automate financial health, we face fascinating product challenges, like building decision-making AI and “human in the loop” machine learning. We’re building groundbreaking technology to make financial health approachable, simple, and automatic for our members. In doing so, our members can focus on other important parts of their lives, knowing that Digit has them covered.

Eikon’s discovery platform is built on groundbreaking innovations from its founders (Nobel Prize, 2014), culminating in the creation of microscopes which enable real time, molecular-resolution measurements of protein movement in living cells. 

By directly measuring the effects of chemical compounds on the behavior of protein molecules in a live cellular environment, Eikon’s landmark assays facilitate the highly sensitive identification of compound-protein interactions that could not be identified through traditional assays, thereby unlocking otherwise intractable classes of proteins as drug targets. Furthermore, the ability to directly visualize protein mechanisms in disease coupled with the extraordinarily high-powered high-content data sets generated by Eikon’s drug-screening technology enable an unprecedented opportunity to quantitatively explore novel biology in the living cell. These insights facilitate creation and application of data-driven hypotheses to the discovery of life-saving therapies.

Casavo is Italy’s first “instant buyer”, offering tremendous value to both sellers and buyers of residential real estate in Southern Europe. Casavo is addressing a critical pain point in the property marketplace by significantly reducing the time it takes to transact. On average, it takes seven months to sell a residential property through the traditional channels in Italy’s main cities. However, Casavo simplifies the process, allowing sellers to avoid the hassles and uncertainties associated with the different phases of the sale process.

Today, we have 9 locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. We’ve performed 225,000 facials, collected data on skincare conditions, preferences, and purchases, and become an employer of choice for a world-class team of estheticians we call Heyday Skin Therapists.

Our next chapter is to take these ingredients and create unparalleled personalization and guidance across content, communities, recommendations, and services in both our physical stores and our e-commerce experience.

‘Heyday’ means a period of your life when you’re feeling at your best. Above all, we exist to help people achieve their ‘heyday’ – to show up in the world as their best selves, every day. We start with the skin you’re in.

In September 2018, we introduced a new health area, medication response, to help people understand how their genes may influence response to certain medications. 

By combining state-of-the-art software with clinical genomics, we’re building a personal health service that helps people benefit from the information in their own bodies. Early detection helps individuals create preventative plans with their doctors using appropriate screening guidelines relative to their personal and familial risk of certain diseases including cancer and heart disease.

Our team helps entrepreneurs shift the balance away from established companies.  Operating with the philosophy that disruptive, high-growth companies hold intrinsic, quantifiable value, The London Fund works closely with founders to help identify and extend a company’s intellectual property assets into a truly defendable position.

While all our partners bring strong operational and entrepreneurial backgrounds to every portfolio company, we also show companies a clear pathway towards an exit. Having experienced four IPOs and over 20 acquisitions as co-founders coupled with investment experience that shows an investment team track record that realized IRR’s in excess of 20% and multiples of over 4x on original investment since 2002, we know how to truly build successful businesses with the lowest weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

This focus on seeking, developing and defending quantifiable IP forms the fundamental difference between The London Fund and other investors.

Between them, cancer and heart disease constitute the two biggest causes of death worldwide. In September 2018, we introduced a new health area, medication response, to help people understand how their genes may influence response to certain medications.

Founded out of MIT in 2013, Superpedestrian develops technologies for micro-electric vehicles that optimize safety, reliability, and performance. 

Superpedestrian spent over 4 years developing its proprietary Vehicle Intelligence system, which was first introduced in the company’s consumer product, the Copenhagen Wheel. Since 2018, Superpedestrian has focused its efforts on engineering and validating its new electric scooter for shared fleets. Featuring the mature Vehicle Intelligence platform, Superpedestrian’s fleet scooter can detect and protect against more than 100 common malfunctions.  This platform of embedded computers and cloud software enables Superpedestrian’s scooters to autonomously protect from damage during and between rides. Within nanoseconds, the scooters can detect potential problems such as battery fires, short circuits, or failed brakes, and take corrective action to avert damage. 

Vehicle Intelligence prevents over 50% of issues that would cause other scooters to fail, and streamlines operations if issues arise. If the scooter can’t protect itself, it automatically becomes unavailable for rental and generates a detailed service ticket for repair. The result is a substantial improvement in vehicle safety for scooter riders and major cost savings for fleet operators.

We work for health systems to design, build, and operate advanced clinical care models in the home and community to expand total capacity and improve access​.

In late 2021, Ronald Paulus, MD, a health system CEO, and Adam Groff, MD, a home and community services entrepreneur and hospital medicine physician, came together to enable health systems to respond to inevitable demographic shifts and workforce constraints driving care out of hospitals and into the home. Together, they founded Maribel Health to design, engineer, and operate the capabilities – including technology, clinical models, and operational management services – in order to  enable the home and community to be increasingly central to both patients’ and health systems’ success.

Maribel focuses on solutions that augment the home-based workforce to deliver more advanced clinical services. As a technology-enabled operating partner of health systems, Maribel enhances capabilities and integration of existing home and community organizations to expand total health system capacity. Examples of work underway include building out hospital-at-home logistics and clinical operations, community-based palliative care, mobile integrated health / community paramedicine, and longitudinal complex chronic care with our partners.

Maribel Health is named in honor of Maribel Sanchez Souther who died in 2016 at age 41 after a two-and-a-half-year battle with triple-negative breast cancer. She lived an amazing life as a wife, mother of three, friend, Ivy League coach, and All-American runner. During her treatment, Maribel had multiple hospital admissions that took her away from her young family. Often, these issues could have been addressed more effectively in the home with the right support and technology. Maribel Health exists so that patients like Maribel receive the care they deserve where they need it most - in their home.",maribelhealth.com,,Hospitals and Health Care,https://www.linkedin.com/company/maribelhealth,,1,1-10 employees

At JiGSO Listen, your team(s) start by filling out scientifically validated surveys. Some of our topics:

- Team cohesion
- Psychological safety
- Team effectiveness
- Diversity, equity & inclusion

You find the results of the surveys immediately and clearly structured in the “My Team” section, which enables teams to be in the driving seat.

Instant and transparent access for all team members. No delay, no secrecy, no filtering. 

The perfect starting point for teams to start a dialogue on their team performance and to take shared ownership. 

Including practical tutorials for team leaders on how to facilitate an open and honest team conversation.

Moving from insights to actions is not always easy. For each dimension of every questionnaire, the platform suggests concrete action scripts and bite-size learnings and tools. 

Small and feasible, yet impactful. No expertise or external support required. Teams can move from knowing to doing in no time, at their own pace, and adapted to their own level of maturity and comfort.

The “Birdseye view” gives you an overview of the results of all teams in your organization. This allows you to zoom in on team level and find out which teams could use some more support.

Jigso Listen is incredibly easy to set up and use. You do not need to install extra software.

Once you’re up and running, we continue to give you extensive support and expertise.

Ao investigar suas faturas, Pedro se deu conta que, por ano, gastava um salário mínimo em tarifas bancárias - quase o mesmo que sua renda mensal na época. Inconformado, Pedro pensou sobre os milhares de brasileiros que perdem seu dinheiro todo ano com taxas substanciais, a partir daí, em 2016, surgiu a Neon, primeira conta digital do Brasil.

Com o passar dos anos, a Neon foi se consolidando como uma das maiores fintechs do país e crescendo em ritmo acelerado. Hoje já são mais de 22 milhões de clientes que contam com a Neon como sua parceira do corre.   

E pra fazer tudo isso acontecer, temos um time de mais de 2 mil Neowners movidos pelo propósito de diminuir desigualdades porque acreditamos que todas essas pessoas, que antes perdiam grana com tarifas injustas, merecem uma vida mais próspera. 

Podemos ser responsáveis no propósito e firme em buscar performance, mas a gente se diverte ao longo da jornada. Afinal, só vamos sossegar quando houver caminhos financeiros mais simples e justos para todas as pessoas. Falta muito pra gente sossegar, né?
